# C++ Object-Oriented Programming Assignments

This repository contains a collection of C++ assignments and practice problems focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). These assignments are part of my coursework at FAST University, Peshawar.

Each file demonstrates core OOP concepts in C++, including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, file handling, operator overloading, and more.
